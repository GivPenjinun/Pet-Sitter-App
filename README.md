Pet sitter applications were developed for pet lovers to find suitable pet sitters for their lovely pets. This app has two roles: pet owner and pet sitter. Each role has its own paths and dashbords.
This app can search for and filter for specific petsitters. It has a user dashboard feature that can upload photos, edit users' information, create a new pet's profile, edit or delete, as well as display all booking history. In addition, pet sitters can manage their services and all bookings.
